					<section>
						<h1>Develop a better understanding on how new modes of intra-party democracy are used to engage citizens in party politics. </h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Worries that political parties have lost touch with civil society and thus loosing their legitimacy (Biezen, Mair, and Poguntke 2012; Mair 2013) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Studies of how political parties attempt to counter this, mostly focus on: 
								<ul>
									<li class="fragment">New types of membership/looser party affiliations </li>
									<li class="fragment">Well established intra-party processes in new contexts to increase the incentive to be a member of/affiliated with parties: Fx. Internal primaries to select party candidates, direct leadership elections, and ballots on strategic decisions. </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">Democratic innovations as a supplement to representative democracy and party politics
								<ul>
									<li class="fragment">(thus adding democratic legitimacy to political decisions, but not to the political parties themselves)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">But parties still dominate political life (agenda-setting, governments), so it is relevant that they are themselves democratic (Teorell 1999)</li>
							<li class="fragment">New parties emerge which explicitly aim to re-engage citizens in party politics (or at least claim to do so) </li>
							<li class="fragment">And they claim to do this through experimenting with new ways of <em>doing</em> party politics. </li>
							<li class="fragment"></li>
						</ul>
						<h3 class="fragment">=> Risk that traditional theoretical frameworks of intra-party democracy does not capture citizen/membership engagement in these new parties. </h3>
						
						<p class="fragment">This is particularly the case, when it comes to party members and affiliates' role in shaping party policies (wiith the exception of Gauja 2015 little attention has been devoted to this topic). </p>

						<h2>Defining democratic innovations </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Graham Smith's definition: “institutions that have been specifically designed to increase and deepen citizen participation in the political decision-making process.”(Smith, 2009: 1)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Elstub and Escobar’s definition: “processes or institutions that are new to a policy issue, policy role, or level of governance, and developed to reimagine and deepen the role of citizens in governance processes by increasing opportunities for participation, deliberation and influence.” (Elstub and Escobar 2019, 11) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Direct citizen participation at strategic levels of government</li>

						<h2>Challenges at this point </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Selecting and identifying democratic innovations within parties: 
							<ul>
								<li>Where does one democratic innovation/institution stop and the next start? </li>
								<li>Identifying comparable institutions/processes across parties.</li>
								<li>One idea: Distinguish between level of influence: Policy development, candidate selection, leadership election, voting in parliament etc. </li>
								<li>Alternative: Include all opportunities for member/citizen engagement, whether or not it seems innovative </li>
							</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">Challenges with typology: 
							<ul>
								<li>Values of quasi-contingent features are not always mutually exclusive </li>
								<li>For instance sometimes several modes of participation or decision making are in play at the same time. </li>
								<li>And sometimes there are (more or less obvious) differences between formal processes and reality. </li>
							</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h2 class="fragment">Next steps: </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Identify patterns along quasi-contingent featurees in intra-party democratic innovations (but perhaps this requires a larger n study)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Assess the potential of different intra-party democratic innovations to (re-)establish link between citizens and political parties </li>
							<li class="fragment">Consider the impact of intra-party democratic innovations on electoral competitiveness. </li>
